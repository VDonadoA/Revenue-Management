# Revenue-Management Projects

Welcome to the Revenue Management repository! This repository contains two projects that apply revenue management principles to real-world scenarios. 

## ðŸ“ŒProject 1: Congestion Pricing in London

London is considering an extension to its Congestion Charge programme, exploring a two-tier pricing policy for peak and non-peak traffic periods. This study investigates the revenue and environmental impact of the proposed pricing strategy.

### ðŸ“‹ Key Questions Addressed:

- Maximizing Revenue: What single congestion charge maximizes total revenue?
- Peak Pricing Strategy: What peak-hour price maximizes revenue with a non-peak charge set at Â£7?
- Minimizing Emissions: What pricing strategy minimizes emissions while maintaining a minimum revenue of Â£1.1 million per day?
